# Metabolic models of E. coli used to study metabolic changes under high ATP demand

This repository contains kinetic and stoichiometric models of the central carbon and 
energy metabolism of E. coli growing under anaerobic conditions. T

The models have been used in the following study: 
Boecker et al., Deciphering the Physiological Response of Escherichia coli Under High ATP Demand.    

## Repository content 

### 1) Stoichiometric model

The stoichiometric model was used for metabolic flux analysis. The zip file contains
the CellNetAnalyzer project and can be used to reproduce the calculations from the
study (see also the ReadMe file). The SBML file of this model is also provided.


### 2) Kinetic model

This repository contains two kinetic models, each in SBML and Copasi format:

- SBML file Model Version 1
- Copasi file Model Version 1
- SBML file Model Version 2
- Copasi file Model Version 2
