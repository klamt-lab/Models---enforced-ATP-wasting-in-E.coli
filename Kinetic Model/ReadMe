# Kinetic model of the carbon and energy metabolis of E. coli growing under anaerobic conditions

## Repository content 

This repository contains two kinetic models, each in SBML and Copasi format:

- SBML file Model Version 1
- Copasi file Model Version 1
- SBML file Model Version 2
- Copasi file Model Version 2

These two models describe the central carbon and energy metabolism of E. coli growing under anaerobic conditions 
and were used in the following study to analyze the effect of enforced ATP turnover in the cell: 
Boecker S., Slaviero G., Schramm T., Szymanski W., Steuer R., Link H., Klamt S., (2021), 
"Deciphering the Physiological Response  of Escherichia coli Under High ATP Demand". Submitted Manuscript."

## Description
Both models contain 33 metabolites and 28 reactions and consist of two compartments (cytoplasm and external environment). 
The following major pathways are included: glucose phosphotransferase system (PTS), glycolysis, two anaplerotic reactions 
(PEP carboxylase and PEP carboxykinase), left and right branch of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle active under 
anaerobic conditions, the main fermentative pathways (leading to the fermentation products lactate, ethanol, acetate, formate 
and succinate), transport reactions between cytoplasm and external environment, a biomass synthesis reaction a NGAM reaction 
that accounts for non-growth associated maintenance ATP demands, and finally an ATPase reaction that hydrolyses ATP into ADP 
and whose activity depends on the level of the overexpression of the ATPase genes. 

As explained in the above work, model Version 1 and 2 differ for the introduction of:
- an inhibtion term in the PFL reaction, slowing the reaction down when ATP becomes scarse:
- an allosteric inhibition for PYR on the PYK;
- few parameter changes. 

More detailed information on the models can be found in the "Appendix" of the aforementioned paper.
