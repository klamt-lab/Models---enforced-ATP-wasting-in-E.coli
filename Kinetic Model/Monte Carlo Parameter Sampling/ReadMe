# MonteCarlo-paramter-sampling

Monte Carlo parameter sampling for central carbon and energy metabolism of E coli under anaerobic conditions. The model is the same used in the pubblicationBoecker S., Slaviero G., Schramm T., Szymanski W., Steuer R., Link H., Klamt S., (2021), "Deciphering the Physiological Response of Escherichia coli Under High ATP Demand", Submitted".     


NOTE1: The parameter sampling has been performed on Model Version 2 for wild type and High Copy ATPase overexpression. 
NOTE2: in all conditions samplings have been done for 10'000 iterations. The sampling has been performed spanning one order of magnitude around the parameters. 

The repository contains: 
- SCRIPTS: Matlab scripts to perform the sampling and to plot the results. The original code is taken from "Monte-Carlo Modeling of the Central Carbon Metabolism of Lactococcus lactis: Insights into Metabolic Regulation". The code has been modified to read a SBML file and import kinetic equations, parameters, species and reactions. The steady state concentrations and fluxes have been retrieved simulating the model in COPASI. 
- MODEL: kinetic model. Copasi and SBML version. 
- RESULT PLOTS: Flux control coefficients distributions for wild type and for high copy ATPase conditions. 
        - Bar plot. Raws are the effects and columns the causes. The x axis is bound between [-1 +1] for subplots with white background. Subplots with grey background have a x semiaxis between (-10 +10); 
        - Sign distribution of the flux control coefficients. The scale represents the percentage of flux control coefficients having a positive sign. Distributions lying mainly on the negative x-axis are characterized by dark colors, contrarily distributions lying on the positive semiaxis present a white color.
